#Here's some new strange stuffs, remember type it exactly

days = "Mon Tue Wed Thur Fri Sat Sun"
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\Aug"

puts "Here are the days #{days}"
puts "Here are the months #{months}"

puts %q{There's something going on here.
With this weird quote

Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
}
